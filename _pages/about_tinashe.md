I am a third-year graduate student in the Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences at Caltech. My research sits at the intersection of online learning, algorithms, machine learning, and economics. I am particularly interested in how strategic interactions influence learning algorithms, with applications in online markets, healthcare systems, transportation  and networks.

I am fortunate to be advised by Professors <a href="https://adamwierman.com">Adam Wierman</a>   and <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~mazumdar/">Eric Mazumdar</a>. Previously, I received a B.S.E in Computer Science from Princeton, where I had the opportunity to work with Professors <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/">Matt Weinberg</a> on auctions and <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~pmittal/">Prateek Mittal</a> on adversarial machine learning.
